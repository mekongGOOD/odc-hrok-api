##TODO

* Web services should be self-documenting. Perhaps we can use restcomplete? https://npmjs.org/package/restcomplete.
* Aggregation? e.g. some attributes have total columns, but some do not.
* Generic query language, e.g. you could pass in a string like 'name LIKE blah', or 'something > 2'.
* Should support other output formats, e.g. xml.
