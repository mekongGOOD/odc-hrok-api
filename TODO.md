##TODO

###API
* Add ALL current ODC datasets (mYSQL tables) config to the API
* If possible, add self-documenting functionality - perhaps we can use restcomplete https://npmjs.org/package/restcomplete.
* Aggregation? e.g. some attributes have total columns, but some do not.
* Generic query language, e.g. you could pass in a string like 'name LIKE blah', or 'something > 2'.
* Should support other output formats, e.g. xml,csv, other?
* 
###Infographic
* Improve the single demo infogrpahic
* Add more infographics
